
For the proposed dataset and the commonly used dataset [37], we took images with the lowest and highest exposures as inputs. 

For the datasets [1, 23] that include a very large dynamic range, we need to ensure the two selected images contain most information of the scene. 
Therefore, we set a rule to select over-/under-exposed images as follows:
(1) transform all images to gray images; 
(2) obtain effective pixel maps of each image by:
f(x) = 0 if x < 5 or x > 250; f(x) = 1 for others;
(3) perform OR operation between two images in a pixel-wise manner to obtain a binary map to show the effective area covered by the two images; 
(4) count the effective pixels and take the images with the max effective area as over-/under-exposed images.
